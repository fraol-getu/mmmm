arcanist-js
===========

arcanist-js provides an Arcanist unit test engine for running Mocha tests. This may eventually be extended to include support for JS code coverage and detecting relevant tests. We use ESLint for linting - please see [eslint-config-robinhood](https://github.com/robinhoodmarkets/eslint-config-robinhood) for more details.

## Installation

1. Add this repository as a submodule:

 ```console
 $ git submodule add git@github.com:robinhoodmarkets/arcanist-js.git
 ```

1. Load the library and set the test engine by adding these lines to your `.arcconfig`:
 ```json
 "load": [
     "arcanist-js/src/"
 ],
 "unit.engine": "MochaUnitTestEngine"
 ```

1. Make sure you have `npm test` configured to run Mocha in your `package.json`. Example:
```json
"scripts": {
     "test": "node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha --compilers js:babel-core/register --recursive js/test"
}
```

1. Run `arc unit` to run tests.
